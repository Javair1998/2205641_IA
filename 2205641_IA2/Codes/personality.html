                <img src="Assets/personality.JPG" alt="Personality Result From Keirsey">
                <p>Reflection:The results of my personality test stated that I am a rational, and I believe this assessment is accurate. As a critical thinker, I prefer to analyze a situation thoroughly before deciding what to do next, rather than making decision based on my emotions, feelings, or mood towards situation. I strive to approach challenges and decision with a logical and objective mindset, carefully weighing the pros and cons before taking action. This rational approach allows me to make well informed choices that are aligned with my goals and values, rather than swayed by temporary feelings or impulses.</p>
